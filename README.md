# NuroSparX – Web Developer Assignment

This repository contains my solutions to the three exercises:

- **Exercise 1:** Custom post type and marketing data integration.
- **Exercise 2:** API integration with HubSpot and robust error handling.
- **Exercise 3:** Performance optimization plan and implementation.

## Folder Structure

- `exercise-1/` – WordPress CPT, meta, AJAX filtering, GTM tracking.
- `exercise-2/` – HubSpot form handler, backup storage, SQL schema.
- `exercise-3/` – Optimization plan and performance-related code.

Each folder has its own `README.md` describing:
- My approach and reasoning
- Assumptions made
- What I would improve with more time
- How I would test in production (e.g., staging environment, logging, feature flags)
